Bubble Sort Algorithm:

#CODE
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i)
        for(int j = 0; j < length - 1; ++j) {
            if(nums[j] > nums[j + 1]) {
                int tmp = nums[j];
                nums[j] = nums[j + 1];
                nums[j + 1] = tmp;
            }
        } //finished this inner-loop means we finished 1 pass

#NOTE:
	- We're sure that if we passed 1 pass, we have sorted one element to its place.

#WARNING:
	- Bubble Sort is ineffiency because it still executes whether the array is sorted.
